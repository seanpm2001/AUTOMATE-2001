# Lifesaver

## Why this project is a lifesaver

I used the label `life-saver` for this project. It is not in reference to the candy, it is in reference to how it will save you from a life of manual, repetitive work via automation (if you have enough projects, it definitely is a life saver due to how much time it will save you)
