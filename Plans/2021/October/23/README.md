### Process

Sandbox repo to test on

Select projects to automate through the AUTOMATE-2001 project

### Confirm automation

_Should this project be done manually?_ **Absolutely NOT** (I have already spent hundreds of hours on it, but there is still too much left to do manually)

_Would it take at least 4x more time to do the task manually?_ **YES**

_Would automation save time?_ **Most definitely**

_Extra: How much time do you think you would save from automation?_ **At least 4000 hours across 2+ years**
