# AUTOMATE-2001

## GitHub

This is the library for GitHub automation. It is designed for the personal use of [@seanpm2001](https://github.com/seanpm2001/) but it can work for other people as well, provided you do the same tasks as me.

It is currently written in JSON, JavaScript, and Python. This is a collection of tools to ease the maintenance of GitHub repositories.

[API](/GitHub/API/) - For interacting with the GitHub API

> [Discussions](/GitHub/API/Discussions/) - For the automation of GitHub discussions

> [RepoData](/GitHub/API/RepoData/) - For the automation of GitHub repository data backups.

[Pages](/GitHub/Pages/) - For keeping GitHub pages active, and not letting the site become stale and unusable.

**More automation tools coming soon.**
