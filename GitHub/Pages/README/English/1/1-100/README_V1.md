# GitHub Pages

## Push

This is a script that houses a tool to automate the process of GitHub pages activity. Once every month, it adds an entry to a text file, so that the page will be re-indexed, so that the site won't become unstable and unusable due to the environment expiring.

There are already many tools to do this, I decided to include my own, as it is so simple to do.
